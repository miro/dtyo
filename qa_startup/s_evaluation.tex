% ECO:  p. 127 harmful combinations PREVENTIVE

Capers Jones has interpreted from the research of multiple years of software quality that there can be harmful combinations of methods used. Even when combinind harmful methods with helpful ones, the harmful method seem to end up winning. That is, defect potentials are raising instead of coming down. Some methods combined with others can raise the defect potentials and make applications risky with a change of failure.
