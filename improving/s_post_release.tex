\section{Post Release}

After a software product has been released to the market, it practically always still has defects in it. IBM calls these defects latent defects, because before the release, these defects have not yet been found as problems to customers. The existence of these defects is due to the imperfect effectivity of the defect removal. Usually the defect removal efficiency is around 85\% and virtually never reaches 100\%.

Some latent defects can be defects found during the development or testing but ones that have not been repaired before the release of the software. Other defects were present in the application, but not discovered by the developers or test personnel. Furthermore, some defects can be originated from new development or other defect repairs in the form of bad fixes. The last two weeks before the release can bring in from about 1\% to even 5\% of delivered defects.
